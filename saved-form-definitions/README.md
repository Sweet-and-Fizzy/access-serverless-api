# Saved Form Definitions

Form field IDs and names are available via API at these URLS:

https://access-ci.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/2/requesttype/17/field
https://access-ci.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/2/requesttype/30/field
https://access-ci.atlassian.net/rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/2/requesttype/31/field

We will likely want to use these dynamically to keep things fresh, but for now, this directory stores a copy of these as data both for access and for AI-assisted development.
